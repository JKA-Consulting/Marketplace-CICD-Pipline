# Marketplace-CICD-Pipline

This repo holds the codes and scripts to setup the environment on Google cloud.
After enabling necessary APIs using the [MarketPlace-API repository](https://github.com/JKA-Consulting/MarketPlace-API), we then use this repo to deploy an instance upon which Jenkins will be installed.

## Tools Used
